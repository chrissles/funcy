SUPPLEMENTARY PACKAGE
In order to use method "pace" in regFuncy, the additional package funcyOctave must be installed.
funcyOctave is an interface to the MATLAB package PACE conducting a functional principal component analysis by conditional estimation (PACE).
It can be downloaded from the website:
